# PCIKF_Code
* Case1 is programmed with Matlab & Python, PCIKF.m and IEnKF.m are two main programs with respect to two methods repectively. 
  gas_00 is used for copying to satisfy parallel computing, and gas_999 is used to generate true observations.
  
* Case2 is programmed only with Python. As the same with Case1, PCIKF.py and IEnKF.py are main programs. Besides, utils contains 
  all the programs to be called by the main programs.
